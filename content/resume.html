<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Senior Software Developer</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.emarsys.com">Emarsys</a>, 2018 - Present</p>
<p>Started at Emarsys again after moving back to Vienna. New team, new position and new challenges.</p>

<h3>Senior Software Developer</h3>
<p><a href="http://trialbee.com">Trialbee</a>, 2017 - 2018</p>
<p>Worked at Trialbee, a medical startup, in Malmö on their new Medical Trial Platform. A small team meant that I got to work with everything from the React web application, the React Native mobile application to the GraphQL powered backend written in NodeJS. </p>
<p>Left the company early due to the family and me moving back to Vienna. </p>

<h3>Lead Developer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.emarsys.com">Emarsys</a>, 2010 - 2017</p>
<p>I continued working on existing and new products for the Emarsys platform. Working in a constantly growing and very independent team I was also involved in product design besides the actual development.</p>
<p>As Lead Developer I was part of an effort to migrate existing J2EE structure to a more modern REST based micro-service architecture built using both Scala and NodeJS. Part of this effort also included automating setup of servers using Ansible. Other responsibilities included reviewing all changes to code and architecture.</p>

<h3>Software Developer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.emarsys.com">Emarsys</a>, 2004 - 2010</p>
<p>Starting at Emarsys in Vienna in 2004 I was part of a small team that developed multiple products for the Emarsys marketing platform. Most work was done in Java and J2EE using JBoss.</p>
<p>One of the biggest products I was part of developing, was a system for sending highly personalized marketing emails in very big volumes. I was heavily involved in database design, service architecture as well as the mail-engine development.</p>
<p>Apart from writing code we were also responsible for running the system, which meant doing deployments and standby duty for when things went catastrophic.</p>

<h3>Java Developer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.densitet.com">Densitet AB</a>, 2004</p>
<p>In the early spring of 2004 I was part of a team developing a prototype system for Densitet AB located in Karlskrona. I was responsible for the mobile-access part and wrote a client in J2ME which communicated, using XML, with their existing MOSES system. Besides the client I also wrote a few Java-servlets providing the client with additional functionality.</p>

<h3>Java Developer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.bth.se">Blekinge Institute of Technology</a>, 2003</p>
<p>I was part of a team to develop a new system for handling courses and schedules at Blekinge Institute of Technology. The system was written following the MVC pattern and the controller layer were written in pure Java and utilizing an Oracle database in the data model layer.</p>
<p>The system could be accessed using two different views, one based on Java Servlets which together with template technology could be accessed from the web and another one written in Java Swing for accessing parts of the system from a normal application. Besides the actual implementation I also took part in the design of both the system architecture and the database model.</p>

<h3>Web Developer</h3>
<p>Karlshamn Kraft AB, 1999, 2001 & 2002</p>
<p>During the summer of 1999 I was hired as web-programmer and worked on their Intranet system. This was mainly done i ASP/VBScript/JScript.</p>
<p>The following summer I worked on their document handling system. I wrote some web-interface parts as well as some tools for converting/transferring data from their older systems into the new system.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2002 I continued my work on their document handling system. I continued writing tools for converting/transferring data from older systems to the new one, creating web-interface parts for searching and registering documents and also wrote stored procedures for the database backend.</p>

<h3>Private projects</h3>
<p>I usually have some project of my own that I am working on, it is often some small application or plugin that helps me in my daily work. Examples of some of the more serious projects are:</p>

<h4>Take Away</h4>
<p>A Mac app, written using Cocoa and Objective-C, for keeping iTunes libraries in sync across multiple machines. Development stopped after Apples announcement of iTunes Match.</p>

<h4>Prequel</h4>
<p>Minimal library making handling of SQL queries in Scala a bit easier. It takes care of connection handling/pooling, SQL escaping, parameter conversion and to some extent transaction handling.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/jpersson/prequel">More information</a></p>

<h4>Rabbel</h4>
<p>A client for the XML-based Instant messaging platform <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a>, written for Mac OS X/Cocoa and Linux/GNUstep in Objective-C. Designed to be modular and easy to extend with new functionality it relies heavily on plugins providing protocol-specific functionality. This in order to be able to cope with the changes of the Jabber extension protocols.</p>

<h4>BeOrganised</h4>
<p>A personal information manager written in C++ for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">BeOS</a>, implemented using file attributes making it very integrated with system. Supported both appointments and todos.</p>

<h4>Olmeki</h4>
<p>Minimal <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> client written in C++ for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">BeOS</a>. Was written out of necessity and supported only the chat-related parts of the protocol.</p>
