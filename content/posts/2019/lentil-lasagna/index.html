<h2>Recipe</h2>
 <p>Inspired very loosely by the vegan lasagne by <a href="http://www.javligtgott.se/vegansk-lasagne/">Gustav Johansson at JÃ¤vligt Gott</a>.</p>

<h3>Tomato-souce</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Green lentils</li>
  <li>Can of crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>3-4 carrots</li>
  <li>Vegatable broth</li>
  <li>Various Herbs</li>
</ul>

<p>Made the Bechamelesauce with olive-oil, flour and almond milk since that was what we had at home, turned out quite ok</p>
