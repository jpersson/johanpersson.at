Again it's time for some thursday picnic food for the kinder-gruppe. This time I thought I would try out the delicious looking pizza-muffins that I saw at [Mina Romas Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05xFU8O2xgY)

## Recipe

Minas recipe can be found in the description of [her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05xFU8O2xgY). I made some slight alterations to the filling to fit my taste a bit. This recipe yielded 36 muffins.

### Filling

* 2 Onion
* 100g of smoked Tofu
* 400g of firm tofu
* 400g of silken tofu 
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 3 tbsp white wine vinegar
* 3 tbsp potato starch
* 2 tsp coconut oil
* Salt
* Black pepper

Saute the onions, cut the smoked tofu into small cubes and put both aside. Blend the rest of the ingredients and make sure you have enough salt and pepper. 

### Putting it together

I used store bought pizza-dough since I'm lazy but you can of course make your own if you have the time. You will need a muffin-pan to make sure the muffins keep the form. 

Cut the dough into 5x5cm pieces and put each piece in its form in the pan. Put some (1 tsp) tomato sauce in each muffin and make sure it covers the dough. Now fill each muffin to 80% percent to have some room for dough expansion. 

The only thing left now is to top each muffin with something you like on pizza. I went with smoked tofu pieces and pineapple (üëãüèª Patrick) and put the whole thing into the oven at 180C for 30min.


## Verdict

~~I'll update once I hear back from the kids. ü§ûüèª~~

Nils really liked the Muffins, at least the ones topped with smoked tofu since he's not a fan of pineapple. But some of the other kids heard muffins and expected something sweet and were then disappointed when it was not.
