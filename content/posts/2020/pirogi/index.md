title: "Cooking for kids"

About a week ago our oldest started pre-school, a really nice and friendly place called [Amerling Kindergruppe Haus](http://www.kindergruppeamerlinghaus.at) located in the middle of Spittelberg in the 7th district of Vienna. There are a lot of things you can say about this pre-school but for this specific blog entry there are two things of interest.  

1. It's parent-controlled ‚úåüèª
2. It's nowhere near where we live üòì

This means that all the food eaten by the 13 kids who make up the group is cooked and prepared by the parents. For me this means that I have sometimes get to cook for the 13 kids and the caretakers and transport the whole thing by bike from Wilhelminenberg where we live down to the Spittelberg.

I'm glad that we never sold off our old but little used [Thule Carrier]() which I now use to transport Nils down everyday. Luckily the route is quite nice and only takes around 20-25 minutes.

I thought it could be an interesting series of posts to document the food and how it's received by the kids. 

## Round #1

Our first day to cook for was a an excursion day which means that you need to prepare something which is easy to bring and eat when out in the woods or in a park. Initially I planned to make some kind of wraps filled with tofu, humus, beans and so on which is a favorite among our own kids. But after the seeing the damage after Bj√∂rn ate his wrap last weekend I decided that it might be better to have something easier to eat. I settled for another favorite. Pirogi filled with vegan minced meat.

### Recipe

I based the recipe on [one that I found](https://undertian.com/recept/piroger-med-svamp-och-spenatfyllning/) on one of my favorite recipe-page, [undertian](https://undertian.com). I doubled amounts for the recipe and got around 20-25 pirogi.

#### Dough

* 5 dl vatten
* 2 dl rapeseed-oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 package yeast
* 16 dl wheat flour

Mix finger-warm water with the yeast, oil and salt. Add flour and make the dough and then let it rest for 45-60 min. 

#### Filling

I did a tomate based sauce with [Soja Granulate from Vegavita](https://vegavita.at/unsere-produkte/sojagranulat/) but any kind of minced meat replacement could be used. 

#### Putting it together

Once the dough is well rested divide it into 20-25 pieces and make them into small balls. Now roll them into circular pieces and put the filling on one half and the fold the other half over and seal it using a fork.

* Prepare the sauce one day ahead to make sure it is not too watery when making the pirogi.
* For kids it better with many small pigori than one big one.
* Don't put too much filling due avoid leakage when baking. 

### Verdict

I'll update once I hear back from the kids. ü§ûüèª
